        <p>

            Sub-Saharan Africa’s population is expected to increase by 124% in the next 20 years, 
            yet its grid extension has advanced slower than in any other major regions in the world; 
            approximately one third of the urban residents and 8% of the rural population are connected 
            to the electrical grid (Rabah 2005). Not only is grid connection sparse across the region, 
            but problems of <strong>intermittency and reliability</strong> are <em>increasingly</em> evident (Rabah 2005). 
            While Sub-Saharan Africa is the poorest global region in terms of energy access, it is the 
            richest in solar endowment (Quansah 2016); as depicted in figure 3, most african nations receive 
            more than 2000 kWh of global solar radiation annually.

            In addition to lowest global energy access rates, Sub-Saharan Africa contains the highest food insecurity rates, 
            lowest literacy and primary school rates, and the lowest health outcomes globally (i.e. infant and maternal mortality 
            rates etc) (Amankwah-Amoah). Due to high solar radiation levels coupled with high levels of impoverishment, 
            Sub-Saharan Africa has not only been a primary location for foreign aid and development programs, but additionally has 
            seen an increase in foreign and state led solar PV initiatives. Small-scale decentralized solar systems have particularly 
            been chosen and portrayed as the ‘cure-all’ to the region’s impoverishment.
